# Contributing
Anyone can contribute by making pull requests which will be reviewed by GitHub collaborators. Note that currently, when compiling for Windows, [<u>GCC</u>](https://gcc.gnu.org/) has been known to fail, so use [<u>MSVC</u>](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).

## Commit practice
Stick to using [<u>conventional commits</u>](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) whilst developing within this repo. This will make it easier for not only contributors to read through commits when necessary (and use related tools) but also helps interested users understand the state of the repository quickly.

## Document Writers
For those who don't mind changing the [__README.md__](./README.md) here and there when necessary, please note that the one stored in the [__docs__](.) folder is the real file and the file in the root directory is a hardlink. There is a minor style to follow when writing links.

### Links
Internal reference links, such as [__CONTRIBUTIG.md__](./CONTRIBUTING.md) are bold;
```md
[__CONTRIBUTING.md__](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
```
and external links, such as [<u>this repository</u>](https://github.com/KingPEPSALT/ImForge) are underlined.
```md
[<u>this repository</u>](https://github.com/KingPEPSALT/ImForge)
```
